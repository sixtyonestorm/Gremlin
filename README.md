## API Integration

The app communicates with a backend server to send and retrieve user data. The backend is built with **Express.js and MongoDB**, ensuring efficient data handling. Below is an example of how user data is sent to the server:

```ts
const sendUserData = async (userData: UserData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://XXX.herokuapp.com/api/user-data", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(userData),
    });
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to send user data");
    console.log("User data sent successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending user data:", error);
  }
};
```

### Endpoints

The backend exposes several endpoints for various functionalities:

- `POST /api/user-data`: Save user details to the database.
- `GET /api/user/:id`: Fetch user data by ID.
- `PUT /api/user/:id`: Update user information.
- `POST /api/invite`: Track and register invited users.

## Deployment

The project is hosted on **Heroku**, but it can be deployed to other cloud platforms like Vercel, AWS, or DigitalOcean. To deploy your own version on Heroku:

```sh
npm run build
heroku create your-app-name
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
